# Research Methodologies

Notes will be sent. I'll put up a link to a dropbox. (TO-DO)
Instructor talked about theories of reasearch. Type of research such as ethnological, historical, etc

#### Research Ethics
We also dealt with research ethics. Basically, the major issues are how to deal with data privacy, the integrity of the researcher, the general treatment of research subjects, plagiarism and citation, 

#### Sources of Data
Different sources. Most importantly, the internet, journals, research houses.
This brings a problem of evaluating the accuracy especially of web data. 

#### Data Abstraction
Process of establishing a theory that attempt to relate data to a result.
This invloves, theory, concepts, variables, indicators, values, etc

#### Data Measurement
Nominal
Ordinal
Interval
Ratio

#### Data Collection Methods

###### Sampling
Probability Sampling - Using probabilities to choose the sample. 
Non-probability sampling - Random selection of the sample.

###### Interrogation
Closed Format Questions - Definite answer to definite question
Open Format Questions - Answer as you want.

###### Interviewing
Structured - 
Unstructured - Let the interviewer ramble
Semi-structured - Some questions have to be asked

###### Experiment
True experiment - 
Quasi experiment -
Pre-experimental design -


## Modelling

3 types of models
Diagrammatic
Physical
Mathematical

## Data Analysis
Two types

Quantitative and Qualitative

Types of analyses:
Univariate
Bivariate
Multivariate

Types of Univariate Analyses:
Frequency Distribution

Measures of central tendency
Mean, median, mode

When the mean, median and mode are at the same value, we have a *Perfect Normal Distribution*

This introduces skewness, a deviation of mean and median to the mode. Either negatively or positively.

Measures of Dispersion:
Standard deviation, Variance

BiVariate Analysis
Anova Tables - Analysis of Variance Tables

Multivariate Analysis


Statistical Tests (Non-Parametric)
